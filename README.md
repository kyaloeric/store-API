# Rics E-Commerce Site  using 

Welcome to the E-Commerce site I've built using the Fake Store API! This readme provides an overview of my project, including its purpose, features, and how to run it.

## Project Description

This project is an e-commerce website created by utilizing the Fake Store API, HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript . The main goal is to display products fetched from the Fake Store API and provide a seamless online shopping experience for users.

## Features

Here are the key features of the e-commerce site:

1. **Display All Products**: When a user loads the site, all available products from the Fake Store API are displayed, giving users a comprehensive view of the available items for purchase.

2. **Product Categories**: Users can browse products by specific categories. This allows them to narrow down their search to find items that match their interests.

3. **Product Details**: When a user clicks on a product, they can view detailed information about that product. This includes its name, description, price, and other relevant details.

4. **Shopping Cart**: Users have the ability to add products to their shopping cart. They can specify the quantity of items they want to purchase and add products to the cart.

5. **Cart Management**: Users can easily manage their shopping cart. They can remove items from the cart, change the quantity of items, and clear the entire cart.

6. **Grand Total Calculation**: The shopping cart keeps track of the items added and calculates the grand total for the user, making it convenient for them to understand the cost of their selected items.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Project**: Navigate to the project directory in your preferred code editor.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. This may include a web server for serving the website and a build process for TypeScript, if you used it.

3. **API Integration**: Ensure that the Fake Store API is accessible and functional. If necessary, refer to the [Fake Store API documentation](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs) for more information on how to interact with it.

4. **Launch the Site**: Use your web server or development environment to launch the site. Access the site through a web browser to interact with it.
